However, there is a significant disparity between their income and expenses, indicating that they have substantial disposable income.

            "\n",
            "- Low-Risk Assets (e.g., bonds, CDs): 40%\n",
            "- Moderate-Risk Assets (e.g., dividend stocks, real estate investment trusts): 30%\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Recommended Budget:** Based on the user's income and expenses, they have a surplus of $2,000 per year. This indicates that the user is living within their means and has some room for discretionary spending and investments. However, to ensure long-term financial stability, it is recommended that the user allocate 20-30% of their income towards saving and investments. With their current expenses and income, this translates to a recommended savings allocation of $4,000 to $6,000 per year.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Risk Level for Investment:** The user has indicated a high risk tolerance. Given their investment amount of $4,000, a suitable investment strategy would be to allocate a mix of high-growth assets, such as stocks and equity funds, in a ratio of 70-80% to lower-risk assets like bonds and fixed income funds in a ratio of 20-30%. This will provide the potential for higher returns while also managing risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Additional Recommendations:** Considering the user's high risk tolerance and relatively stable financial situation, it is recommended that they consider contributing to a tax-advantaged retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA, to supplement their retirement savings. Additionally, the user should regularly review and adjust their investment strategy to ensure it remains aligned with their financial goals and risk tolerance.\n",
